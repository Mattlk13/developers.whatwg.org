# Former home of the HTML Standard, developer's edition

This repository used to contain scripts that would generate the [developer's edition of the HTML Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/). These days, the developer's edition is maintained directly in the [whatwg/html](https://github.com/whatwg/html) repository itself. For more information on contributing there, see:

- [The blog post announcing the move](https://blog.whatwg.org/developers-edition-comeback)
- [The guidelines for contributing to the developer's edition in whatwg/html](https://github.com/whatwg/html/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-developers-edition)

In the meantime, all of the old resources are still there, [in the Git commit history](https://github.com/benschwarz/developers.whatwg.org/tree/97ff943a8f5b8fe38f78e224b4b44b472ccefb57)! The old built version is also available, [on archive.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20170603005743/https://developers.whatwg.org/). Feel free to consult them for ideas on improving the new version!
